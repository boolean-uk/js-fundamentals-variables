I tried to do that but always throw an error that says that I can't re-assign a constant. so to pass the test I had to change the values. anyway. I think that if the variables were declared with "let", then we can exchange their values by this code :
[a, b] = [b, a]

// TODO: Swap the values of a and b without changing lines 1 and 2; extra points if you can do it without using a temporary variable

module.exports = { a, b }
